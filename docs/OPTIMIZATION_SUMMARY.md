- **After**: All image processing happens in a dedicated WebWorker thread
- **Benefits**: 
  - UI remains responsive during processing
  - Better user experience with no freezing
  - Can handle large images without blocking interface

### 2. **Batch Processing Support**
- **New Feature**: Process multiple images simultaneously
- **Features**:
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Parallel processing with WebWorker
  - Batch download capability
  - Individual file management

### 3. **Advanced Image Optimization**
- **Enhanced Processing**:
  - Sharpening filters for better quality
  - Brightness/contrast adjustments
  - Metadata stripping for smaller file sizes
  - Multiple format support (JPEG, PNG, WebP)

### 4. **Intelligent Presets**
- **Smart Presets**:
  - Web Optimized (1920px wide, WebP)
  - Mobile Friendly (800px wide, WebP)
  - Instagram Square (1080x1080, JPEG)
  - Twitter Header (1200x675, JPEG)
- **Auto-sizing**: Maintains aspect ratio automatically

## üé® User Experience Enhancements
