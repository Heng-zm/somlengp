# ðŸ”§ Firebase App Hosting - Fix for "/scan-qr-code" Lambda Error

## Problem
Error: `Unable to find lambda for route: /scan-qr-code`

## Root Cause
Firebase App Hosting may not be properly routing Next.js App Router pages due to configuration issues.

## Solution Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated `apphosting.yaml` Configuration
Added proper environment variables for Firebase App Hosting:

```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: "production"
  NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED: "1"
  # Force Next.js to use standalone mode
  STANDALONE: "true"
  # Ensure proper routing
  HOSTNAME: "0.0.0.0"
  PORT: "8080"
  # Ensure all Next.js routes are handled properly
  NEXT_RUNTIME: "nodejs"
  # Disable ISR for better Firebase App Hosting compatibility
  NEXT_CACHE: "force-dynamic"
```

### 2. Updated `next.config.js` Configuration
- Confirmed `output: 'standalone'` mode
- Added proper serverActions configuration for large file handling
- Optimized bundle splitting and webpack configuration

## Build Verification âœ…

The route `/scan-qr-code` builds successfully:
```
â”œ â—‹ /scan-qr-code                                16.7 kB         514 kB
```

**Status:** âœ… **Static route - prerendered as static content**

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Clean Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Firebase App Hosting
```bash
firebase deploy --only apphosting
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Wait for deployment to complete
2. Test the route: `https://your-app.web.app/scan-qr-code`
3. Check Firebase App Hosting logs if issues persist

## Alternative Solutions (if still not working)

### Option A: Force Dynamic Rendering
If the static route is still causing issues, we can force dynamic rendering by adding to the `scan-qr-code/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add this at the top of the page component
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

### Option B: Add Route Segment Config
```typescript
// Add to page.tsx
export const runtime = 'nodejs';
export const revalidate = 0;
```

### Option C: Check Firebase App Hosting Logs
```bash
firebase apphosting:backends:logs --backend-id=your-backend-id
```

## Expected Result

After deployment, the `/scan-qr-code` route should work correctly and you should be able to:

1. âœ… Navigate to `/scan-qr-code` without errors
2. âœ… See the QR scanner interface
3. âœ… Access camera functionality
4. âœ… Scan QR codes successfully

## Additional Notes

- The route works perfectly in local development (`npm run dev`)
- This is specifically a Firebase App Hosting deployment configuration issue
- All required dependencies and components are properly installed and configured
