## Troubleshooting Git Push Errors

If you encounter errors when trying to `git push`, here are some common solutions:

### Error: Large files detected (e.g., `node_modules`)

This error occurs when you accidentally try to commit large files that should be ignored.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have a `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory that includes `node_modules`.
2. If you've already committed `node_modules`, you need to remove it from your Git history. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   # Remove all cached files from the index
   git rm -r --cached .
   
   # Re-add everything, respecting the new .gitignore
   git add .
   
   # Commit the change
   git commit -m "Untrack files listed in .gitignore"
   
   # Push the changes to your repository
   git push origin main
   ```
   In some complex cases where large files are deep in your history, you may need to rewrite the history. This is an advanced operation.

### Error: Authentication failed / Missing or invalid credentials

This error means your workspace is no longer securely connected to your GitHub account.

**Solution:**
1. **Refresh Credentials:** Look for an "Accounts" or "Source Control" tab in your IDE (often on the left-hand panel).
2. **Sign Out & Sign In:** Use the options in that tab to sign out of your GitHub account and then sign back in. This will re-establish a secure connection token.
3. **Try Pushing Again:** Once you've successfully re-authenticated, your `git push` command should work.
